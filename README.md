# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Artificial Agricultural Data

An AI-powered Crop Yield Prediction and Advisory System built using Machine Learning.

## 📌 Overview

This system predicts crop yield based on:

- Environmental conditions (Rainfall, Temperature, Humidity)
- Soil nutrients (N, P, K)
- Soil pH
- Crop type and season

It also provides advisory insights and estimated revenue.
